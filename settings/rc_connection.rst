Receiver connection
=========================

To control the drone with RC transmitter, a binding operation is required. Follow this manual to perform it.

.. attention:: Controlling several drones using one RC transmitter might cause crashes. Do not bind more than one receiver to one controller.

1. Turn the RC transmitter on
2. Use touchscreen to navigate the settings menu.
3. Select Rx Bind in “System” tab. “Binding to Rx..” should appear on the screen.
4. Press and hold “BIND” button on the receiver.
5. While holding the button, plug in the battery to turn quadcopter on.
6. Leave the Rx bind mode on the controller. The drone should beep once after this. A light on the receiver should not blink.



If the drone doesn’t react on controller signals, try to re-bind its receiver once again. If this doesn’t solve the problem, contact Geoscan helpdesk: support@geoscan.aero 

.. important:: Binding procedure works for FlySky-A8S receiver.
