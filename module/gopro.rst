The mount is attached to the lower part of the frame with M3x5 screws, providing a solid Gopro camera joint to capture onboard video during flight. Its vertical angle may be adjusted.

Be careful while take-off and landing stages, as the mount with A Gopro affects the quadcopterâ€™s balance and dimensions.
