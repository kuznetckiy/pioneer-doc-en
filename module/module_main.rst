X1 and X2 connectors are situated in the upper part of the main board. Most modules a mounted on the extension board and connect to the main board with parallel cables. GPS and indoor navigation modules are installed directly on the main board.

.. note:: 
 Two connectors differ with contact amount and physical size, so they are NOT interchangeable. Use marking lip on the cable connector and do not push it hard.

The following sections establish connect and programming instructions.

.. note:: Modules are programmed before the flight using `Pioneer Station`_ or `TRIK studio`_

.. _Pioneer Station: ../programming/pioneer_station/pioneer_station_main.html
.. _TRIK studio: ../programming/trik/trik_main.html


**Note that connected modules consume additional energy, which shortens the flight time**
