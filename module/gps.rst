GPS/GLONASS module
======================

The module allows to track current quadcopter's speed and position using global navigation systems. For better accuracy the drone should perform an outdoor flight away from high buildings and metal constructions.

GPS module is mounted on the main board using two connectors and M3 screws. The connector provide \"run-through\" connection to plug in extra modules on the lower board with parallel cables. 
GPS module is also equipped with a compass to get orientation data. This can be corrupted near large metal objects and buildings.

When `connected to Pioneer Station`_, make sure the GPS positioning mode is selected in "autopilot parameters", otherwise activate it manually. You can observe compass working in aviahorizon window when connected to PC in standard mode. The quantity of connected satellites is also shown there. The more satellites is "visible", the more positioning accuracy you gain. First-time activation in new location (cold-start) requires 1-3 minutes for module to synch. In case of success, green light on the module will stop flashing. Now, if disabled and then turned on in the same location after some time, the synchronization process will be much shorter.

If Status led keeps flashing for more than 5 minutes, move the drone to a point with GPS signal. Blue Error led means Pioneer parameters are incorrect (for example, LPS positioning mode is selected).

When flying with radio transmitter control, use loiter mode (SwC switch in middle position) to use GPS module and make the flight significantly more comfortable.

**ap.goToLocalPoint(x, y, z)** function is used for programmed flight. X - axis is directed to the East, Y - axis to the North. Z represents the altitude. 

Pioneer gets its position from the switch-on moment. This point is considered to be (0, 0, 0) in ap.goToLocalPoint command. 

Also, you can use **ap.goToPoint(x, y, z)** function. Here, x and y show geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude) of a point where Pioneer will fly. Z is still for altitude at this point.

.. note:: If stated point is more than 500 meters away from the start, quadcopter will not fly to it. 




Example
-------------

Below is a example of GPS module program. Upload it to Pioneer, find a spacious site and connect the LiPo battery. Wait until module LED stops blinking, then switch SwB to lower position and push "Start" button on the quadcopter's base board. In 5 seconds Pioneer will take-off, fly 10 meters north and return to launch point. 

GPS position and altitude error may reach 3 meters, keep this in mind while planning the flight.
