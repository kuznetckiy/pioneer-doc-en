This module can be used both for video shooting and FPV flights. Runcam Split camera is mounted on a rotating gimbal. Inside the module's body there is a control board with 2 buttons, microUSB connector and microSD slot on it. 4Gb memory card is already installed, and the footage is stored on it. 

Use standard battery cover to mount camera module. Unscrew it from Pioneer, and secure the camera module on it with 4 screws. Then, install it back so that camera is below the quadcopter. Take the lower module cover to get access to Runcam Split control board. 

Plug the camera connector to X1 on the Pioneer base board. Connect the battery to set camera modes.
