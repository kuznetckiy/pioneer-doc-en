Mission example
=========================

First of all, learn to control Pioneer’s LEDs. In TRIK studio, press “open project” and select LED file. Mission diagram should appear in the workspace. Once activated, it will change led colour every second. Feel free to configure the mission to your liking.

Now it is necessary to create correct Lua code. Press “generate to Pioneer Lua” button or use ctrl+shift+G key combination.
