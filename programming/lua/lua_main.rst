Standard Pioneer kit allows LEDs and flight mission programming. Two options are offered, depending on users competence:

    Visual programming using  `TRIK Studio`_

    .. _TRIK Studio: ../trik/trik_main.html

    Advanced programming using `Lua`_

    .. _Lua: lua.html

Lua basics are stated in Learnlua.lua at pioneer stations/examples. Open it with Pioneer Station and get used to syntax and basic command.


.. important:: External module can also be programmed and combined with standard Pioneer functions.
