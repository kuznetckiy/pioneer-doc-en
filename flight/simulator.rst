=====================

If you don’t have proper drone control skills or you want to improve it, it is highly recommended for you to use simulator. It allows you to master the controls without risking the drone.

FlySky F6S RC unit can be connected to PC via USB cable to start your training in any simulator.

To get familiar with buttons and sticks, read `RC Unit`_

Pioneer reaction on sticks movement is described in `Controls`_

Most flight simulators may be quite expensive, but to learn the basics a free or demo version is enough. 

We suggest trying FPVFreerider for that purpose. A free demo can be downloaded `here`_. Just scroll the page down and choose the version for your OS.

.. _here: https://fpv-freerider.itch.io/fpv-freerider

When installation is complete, plug the transmitter to your PC and turn it on. Than start FPVFreerider. All switches and sticks should be in upper position.

Choose “control uing USB” and calibrate controller. Follow the guidance, moving sticks as shown on the screen and clicking OK. When finished, check if everything is done correctly, use sliders to trim for better accuracy. A virtual controller should perform exactly as the real one in your hands.

Then open a available map for flight training session.

It is usually recommended to start flying with third-person view (also called line of sight) in stabilise mode. Use the buttons to the top left corner of your screen to choose self-level, low rates and camera mode like on the screenshot below.

**Flight**:

* Gently push the left stick forward. When the quadcopter lifts off the ground, try to hold it at the same altitude and land, using the throttle stick. Learn the moment when the drone starts to lift off.

* Holding the drone at the same altitude, push the right stick in any direction. Note that the drone not only accelerates but also looses altitude when tilted. To compensate it, add a little bit of throttle with the left stick. Learn to fly in different directions without loosing altitude. You can click Reset button any time to start over.

* Pushing the left stick to the side controls the drones yaw direction. Changing course makes it harder to control as you have to take the shift into account. Try flying in square trajectory, turning the drone 90° in each corner. It will make it easier for you to learn if you do complex movements step by step.

Flying the drone is a skill that requires some practice. Mastering the flight in simulator you will feel your progress. When you can fly in selected direction without loosing or crashing the drone, you are prepared for actual flight using Pioneer.

.. note::
	The simulator gives the ability to learn first person view (FPV) flying as well. To toggle it, switch the camera button in FPV mode.
