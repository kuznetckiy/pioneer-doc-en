Controls
==========

**To control the Pioneer via RC transmitter, follow these rules:**

**Altitude control**

	:align: center

	:align: center

When throttle/yaw stick is pushed forward, the drone will gain altitude and decline when stick pulled down.


**Direction change**

If throttle/yaw stick is pushed right or left, the drone will turn in the given direction.


**Forward/reverse flight**

.. image:: /_static/images/rc_control_4.png
	:align: center

Push the right stick up to tilt the drone and move forward. When stick is pulled down, the drone will tilt and move backwards.


**Moving left/right**

	:align: center

When right stick is moved left or right, the drone tilts and moves in the same direction.


.. attention:: Operating the radio control, move the sticks smoothly. Hold the transmitter with both hands, thumbs on the sticks. Remember that while manoeuvring the drone may decline, and be ready to compensate this by giving a bit more throttle.
