Flight safety
==============================

Pioneer is designed for both indoor and outdoor usage. The temperature should be from 0 to +40 Â°C and humidity no more than 80%. Quadcopter is not intended to fly in the rainy, snowy or windy conditions. Follow these rules for safe operation:

* Make sure there`s no obstacles (tree branches, lamps) above the drone before take-off.
* Look out carefully for wires and cables as they can damage the drone in case of collision. If possible, do not perform flight near such objects.
* Do not fly the drone in gusting wind. A safe wind speed is no more than 5 m/s. Remember that the wind speed and direction may differ with altitude.
* Do not start programs with flight conditions with USB and LiPo connected to the drone. Remove the props in case ESC calibration is required.
* Check the props integrity before every flight. Using a bent of damaged propeller may cause a drone failure.

.. note::
	During flight, propeller damage can be recognised by change in drone sound and performance. Do not continue the flight with damaged prop, if possible
