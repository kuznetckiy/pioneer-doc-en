As a power source, a 1300 mAh LiPo battery is used. This type of battery is lightweight and powerful, but may be fire hazardous if used incorrectly. In this section you will learn to use LiPo battery

**Charging**

#. Choose a incombustible surface to place a charging set. This should be away from any flammable objects (like carpets or curtains)
#. Make sure the battery doesn't have any external damages, bumps or shell fractures.
#. Plug in the charging station to 220v grid
#. Plug the balance connector to the charging station
#. The charge indicators should colour red. The green light indicates the battery is charged 
#. Wait for LiPo to complete charging and unplug it from charging station. Do not leave the charging battery unattended!

.. note::
  For long-term storage it is recommended to discharge it 50% and check every 3-4 moths to prevent a deep discharge lower than 10%. Part-charge if necessary


.. attention::
	Charging or using a damaged LiPo is prohibited. It must be stored separately away from flammable objects until the utilization moment
  

**Operation**

* When placed in the frame, the LiPo wires should be kept away from the props plane
* Plug in the battery before take-off and disconnect it right after the landing
* Don't allow a short circuit between the LiPo contacts. 
* Check the battery for damages, punctures or bumps before and after flight. Heating it above 50\ :sup:`о`\ C and swelling is unacceptable. 


.. danger::
	If the battery is severely damaged, do not try to extract it immediately ! The bend and additional air inflow may cause intensive flame and lead to burn. If you notice a flare or smoke from the drone, land on a non-flammable surface immediately.	

	**Do not try to extinguish the burning LiPo with water!** ДUse dense cloth, sand, soil, carbon dioxide fire extinguisher. If none is accessible, wait for the battery to burn out and utilise it.

	LiPo combustion products are extremely **toxic**, do not breathe in the smoke.
